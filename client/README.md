# RAILS/REACT BOOK LIBRARY APPLICATION
    For my forth project at [FLATIRON SCHOOL](https://flatironschool.com/), I created a book library application, where a signed in user can save their favorite books. 

## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES USED
    I used the following programming languages:
    - RUBY ON RAILS
    - REACT JSX
    - JAVASCRIPT
    - CSS
## HOW TO USE
    On start-up you will see a Home Page that describes the application. There are two routes at the Navigation. One is the Sign Up and the other allows you  to Login. When you sign up you will be able to create a user securely. From there, you will be logged into the application and can Add a Book to your librbary. You also have the ability to edit the books you have stored.
